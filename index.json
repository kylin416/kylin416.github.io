One possible way is to verify that they are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is also known as CalFresh. The proportion of Lifeline participates who qualify via SNAP is around 25-30%. However, between 2021 and 2022, this number suddenly increased to 48.7%. One possible explanation could be the introduction of the CalFresh Confirm tool on September 2021. This tool allows the Third Party Administrator to perform data integrity process (data dip).

Meanwhile, her suicidal companion was also leaving Xiangyang for Wuchang. As agreed, they were going to meet each other at Wuchang train station on 15th and jump in the river together to end their life.\nHowever, their suicidal attempt failed due to the intervention of a suicide intervention group called “tree hole action”.\nCombining online intervention and real-life action, at 9:00 on the morning of 15th, the tree hole rescue team members “intercepted” the two suicidal net friends in less than 45 hours.\nThe rescue team relied on the AI technology to acutely identify the suicidal risk and finally solve the crisis. On July 25th, 2018, scholar Huang Zhisheng developed a “Tree Hole Robot” that could automatically select the comments related to emergency suicidal risks from the tree hole (namely, the microblog of the girl who committed suicide) using the algorithm “Knowledge Graph”, and send a monitor report every four to six hours to the rescue team consisting of over 200 volunteers who would intervene the ones who tried to commit suicide. The suicide risk level of the girl commentator’s suicide invitation was rated at seven. Therefore, after validating the train ticket - the evidence for their suicide invitation - the rescue team immediately launched an emergency crisis intervention and formed a team of 15 people in less than one hour since the girl was on board.\nIn China, the traditional intervention of suicide crisis is psychological crisis hotline, among which Hope 24 Hotline is the backbone of civil Chinese suicide intervention organizations. The hotline was opened in Shanghai in 2012 by Lin Kunhui, life education, crisis intervention expert and Secretary of Suicide Prevention Association from Taiwan. Currently, 21 such hotlines in 17 provinces in China are available. Also open 24/7 is another free official suicide intervention hotline - Beijing Psychological Assistance Hotline.\nOn Guard 24/7: Suicide Crisis Intervention Hotline\u003e On Guard 24/7: Suicide Crisis Intervention Hotline # Beijing Psychological Crisis Research and Intervention Center of Beijing Huilongguan Hospital used to be Clinical Epidemic Diseases Research Room of Beijing Huilongguan Hospital founded by Canadian Fei Lipeng. The initial goal was to research and intervene suicides in China. On December 3rd, 2002, the Center opened “Psychological Crisis Intervention Hotline” (the name was later changed into “Beijing Municipal Psychological Assistance Hotline” in 2010). This is also the first official suicide intervention hotline in China.\nBy September 2017, Huilongguan Psychological Assistance Hotline had more than 30 operators, provided psychological consultancy service to more than 290 thousand people and received and handled more than 10 thousand emergency calls. Since 2015, the percentage of emergency calls had increased continuously from 5% to 11%. The time distribution chart of the calls showed that from 9:00 to 10:00 in the evening, the operators received the largest amount of calls.\nHope 24, another national 24/7 free suicide assistance hotline, consists of volunteers solely. To ensure the professional capability of the operator teams, Hope 24 requires that all operators are certified. After the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security canceled the psychological consultant certificate in 2017, the Hotline provided training to new team members. In 2019, Hope 24 Hotline trained 582 people on crisis intervention.\nAccording to the statistics, in the past year, Hope 24 Hotline received about 200 thousand calls. Excluding the failed calls due to the engaged line, the number of actual calls reached 64,850, mainly consisting of students (46.54%) and employed people (35.87%). According to the Crisis Risk Level Table made by Lin Kunhui, the founder of Hope 24 Hotline, the risk levels are divided from Level 1 to Level 7, among which Level 5 to Level 7 are emergent. Level 5 calls indicate a suicide equation, Level 6 indicate a near approach toward suicide, and Level 7 indicate the happening of suicide. Therefore, people who make calls at the three levels are the main focus of suicide prevention action. In 2019, Hope 24 Hotline received 5,357 emergent-level calls.\nDue to the huge amount of calls and that the operators were all volunteers and were not stable, the risk of losing operators was pretty high. For the 21 branches of Hope 24 Hotline nationwide, it was not easy to guarantee the 24-hour service. Despite having insufficient staffs, Tianjin hoped that Hope 24 Hotline could still run 24/7. In the four years since the open of the Hotline, Tianjin received about 400 emergency calls, among which about 80 people were committing suicide when they called.\nOf the 79 volunteers of Tianjin operators, the leader Li Yongsheng was among the first batch of people who joined the group. As a professional psychological consultant, he worked in his own psychological consultancy clinic while also working in Hope 24 operation room in his spare time.\nLi lost his sight, so he had more acute auditory sense than ordinary people. “I lived on my imagination. By hearing people’s voices, I could imagine their characteristics and their living environment.” Usually, he could accurately judge the emergency level of the people who called in 2-10 minutes.\nNote: considering protecting the privacy and safety of the volunteers, at the request of Hope 24 Hotline, only side face of the operators was shown.\nFrom Passive Rescue to Active Intervention: Suicide Assistance from the Perspective of AI\u003e From Passive Rescue to Active Intervention: Suicide Assistance from the Perspective of AI # According to the Chinese Association for Mental Health, every two minutes one person has attempted suicide since 2000. However, a research conducted by Psychological Research Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences found that among all the people who had the idea of committing suicide, had a suicide plan and attempted at committing suicide, 51.6% didn’t seek any help actively.\nSince people who commit active suicide rarely seek help for treatment, there’s little space for psychological assistance and suicide intervention hotline. Therefore, researchers come up with a new idea of online active suicide prevention. Namely, they can actively identify people who want to commit suicide and have a crisis intervention.\nIn this emerging era of social media, people form communities in the virtual world, exchanging information and also sharing emotions. Many suicidal people choose to talk to complete strangers; this way isolated islands are able to connect.\nA Nanjing University student Zou Fan’s microblog is one such community. After she committed suicide due to depression, her last words on her microblog have become a “tree hole”, with more than 1 million comments so far. Behind the words of despair or frustration, there are countless tormented souls. “The tree hole made me realize that I’m not alone, not a freak,” – people gathered in the comment section to whisper their secrets, share emotions with each other, and to leave suicidal confessions or invitations, looking for fellow travelers towards the end of their lives.\nTop 10 words that were frequently used: no, now, ok, hope, today, why, world, life, pain, hope\nNote: in the cloud tree hole words sketch, different colors symbolize different emotional feelings. Brown symbolizes negative feelings, and the darker the color, the more depressed the feelings. Green symbolizes positive feelings, and the brighter the color, the more positive the feelings. And gray symbolizes neutral feelings.\nSource: the 181,498 comments in Zou Fan’s tree hole between October 2018 and February 2019.\nIn March 2018, Huang Zhisheng learned about the existence of “tree holes” like Zou Fan’s microblog. As a scholar who has dedicated himself to the field of artificial intelligence for more than 30 years and who adheres to the idea that “technology should serve society”, he believes that tree holes can become a breakthrough point for the application of artificial intelligence in the field of health and medical care. Four months later, the tree-hole robot was invented.\nThis artificial intelligence algorithm detects suicide crisis signals on social media, and then attempts rescue. At the same time, according to the urgency and specificity principles, the robot is able to divide suicide risks into eleven levels. “Suicide in progress and specific and practical suicide methods are the most dangerous ones,” says Zhisheng. Today, the tree hole robot undertaking the task of “patrolling” is a sixth generation version, and the core team of “Tree Hole Action” has also expanded to 35 people, including supervisors from different regions and scholars from the fields of artificial intelligence and mental health.\nAccording to the urgency and specificity principles, the robot is able to divide suicide risks into eleven levels. “Suicide in progress and specific and practical suicide methods are the most dangerous ones,” says Zhisheng. Today, the tree hole robot undertaking the task of “patrolling” is a sixth-generation version, and the core team of “Tree Hole Action” has also expanded to 35 people, including supervisors from different regions and scholars from the fields of artificial intelligence and mental health. Due to the considerable number of comments in the tree hole, the rescue scope has been limited to those at level 5 and above. Even so, in the daily monitoring report released by the tree hole robot, there are more than 100 people at the high-risk level of 5 and above, which is equal to one sixth of the total number of suicides in the Netherlands.\nDuring the intensive rescue, the volunteers contact suicidal individuals through various channels such as messages, phone calls and Weibo based on the user IDs captured by the tree hole robots. When encountering intractable situations, they will also cooperate with Sina Internet police who would ask the local police to help with the intervention.\nHowever, crisis intervention only prevents one suicide from happening. Easing mental stress of suicide victims requires long-term psychological counseling. Technology can only help rescue teams identify those who try to kill themselves, but it can’t guarantee that those people will give up the idea of committing suicide entirely. Rescued people who still have psychological problems will most likely choose to end their lives again. Those who suffered from the most severe form of depression even attempted to commit suicide up to eight times within six months.\nTherefore, in addition to short-term suicide interventions, volunteers also offered their company for a longer period. They became friends with the rescued people, affectionately referred to as “tree hole babies”. Whenever a “tree hole baby” is under heavy psychological pressure, he or she can directly communicate with the volunteers to express his or her negative emotions in time.\nThe longest time volunteer Li Hong, kept in touch with a tree hole baby was eight months long. “As long as she persists, we will never let go,” says Hong. A bipolar patient who was once even willing to take her child along with her in death has been working on her issues with Hong for company “As long as (Ms. Li) can stay with me, that’s enough,” she says.\nApart from the company of volunteers, Tree Hole rescue team also relies on the resources of psychological consultancy expert teams and established a green pathway for patients with mental disorder who want to commit suicide in Beijing Municipal Huilongguan Hospital, Beijing An Ding Hospital, Peking University Sixth Hospital, Wuhan People’s Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Nanjing Brain Hospital, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine.\nDilemma: Can the Last Line of Defense be Kept?\u003e Dilemma: Can the Last Line of Defense be Kept? # According to the World Health Statistics Report 2018 published by the World Health Organization (WHO), China’s suicide rate is 9.7 per 100,000 people. The Suicide Situation and Countermeasures in China released by the Beijing Psychological Crisis Research and Intervention Center in 2007 shows that 287 thousand people die from suicide every year, and 2 million attempt suicide.\nWith the large number of suicides and limited funding and human resources, although they are trying to prevent people from falling into the abyss, suicide crisis intervention organizations are falling short of their goal.\nAs a pure and free volunteering institution, it is hard to maintain Hope 24 Hotline. Due to the pressure brought by capital and management issues, Beijing branch of Hope 24 Hotline was forced to stop in only two years since it opened. Therefore, volunteers like Ai Xin (nick name) had to transfer to Tianjin branch at their own cost.\nThe 10 square-meter Tianjin operation room only has enough space for two telephones. However, an emergency call will usually last one to two hours. “A lot of people want to call in for help, but the attempt fails due to busy line.” Hua Haili, the head of Tianjin branch of Hope 24 Hotline said. According to the statistics provided by Hope 24 Hotline, about half of the calls nationwide failed to connect due to busy line every month, and on average, 50% of people gave up and didn’t call again.\nIn order to expand the tree hole rescue team, Zhisheng and his organization has kept the initial threshold for volunteer recruitment as low as possible. Except for patients with mental illness and minors, anyone who is interested can apply.\n“My friends have advised me to raise the bar, but we are now in urgent need of more people. As long as they are enthusiastic, they can participate in the training. Saving lives is above all else after all.” Zhisheng said.\nWith shortage in manpower, more social platforms besides Weibo are also in desperate need of “tree hole robots”. On November 23，2019, Zhisheng received a wrist cutting video through email. The girl’s white wrist and flowing blood were startling. This suicide video was originally posted on QQ Zone by a Chengdu girl. The girl’s friends ware anxious and turned to Zhisheng for help. QQ does not fall into the detecting range of “Tree Hole Action\u0026quot;, but Zhisheng still sent a volunteer immediately to get in touch with the girl and intervene.\nIn addition, external cooperation with suicide intervention agencies has also dicey . Initially, the Tree Hole Rescue Team often hit the wall when they contacted the Internet police of the social platforms. “They don’t know who you are and they don’t believe that someone really wants to commit suicide,” and hence the volunteers’ reports were often turned down because of “insufficient evidence”. It wasn’t until later when the rescue team gained fame, that communication between them became relatively smooth. But the timeliness of the intervention has still not been satisfactory.\nThe Road is Still Tough and Long\u003e The Road is Still Tough and Long # Suicide intervention has always been an important topic in the global public health industry. In the Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020 published by WHO, member states are devoted to realize the goal of reducing suicide rate to less than 10% by 2020.\nAccording to a global suicide prevention research conducted against 157 International Association of Suicide Prevention (IASP) member states by IASP and WHO Mental Health and Substance Abuse Administration in 2013, among the 90 countries that responded (excluding China), 55 countries (61%) regarded suicide as a public health issue that couldn’t be neglected, the government of 28 countries (31%) adopted a comprehensive national strategic or action plan. Most countries started making a national strategic or action plan since 2000.\n“Both WHO and the United Nations require member states to have a national-level suicide prevention plan, but our country has not yet had such a system,” Yang Fude, director of the WHO Collaboration Center for Psychological Crisis Prevention Research and Training, and president of Beijing Huilongguan Hospital, called for a national suicide prevention plan as soon as possible in an interview three years ago. However, till today, China still hasn’t had a complete national suicide prevention system, which indicates the biggest impediment in China’s suicide prevention work.\nIn the United States, national suicide prevention hotline is a national plan sponsored by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and maintained by the capital support of states and local donors. Currently, there are more than 170 local prevention centers, covering 49 states of the US. According to a report published in 2019, 809,265 calls were received, among which about 300 thousand calls failed, making an average connection rate 59%. The percentage is higher than that of China’s civil volunteering group Hope 24 Hotline in 2019, and the reason is closely related to the more capital and social support brought by the “national plan” in the US.\nAccording to Prevent Suicide: a Global Issue published by WHO in 2014, in order to form a national suicide prevention strategy, it is necessary for the government to play a leading role because the government is able to unit together various stakeholders that otherwise wouldn’t have any possible cooperation. What’s more, due to the special position the government has, it can launch and enhance monitoring work and provide and spread statistics.\n“We want the government to be more involved.” Zhisheng, said that by August this year, the rescue team had sent 1,436 “caring messages” to Weibo users with suicidal tendencies, effectively preventing 662 suicides. However, in the future, if this number is to increase further, it is necessary to rely on the concerted efforts of the government, rescue teams and other social organizations to establish an effective responsibility distribution mechanism for suicide intervention.\nZhisheng slid the mouse and watched a monitoring report just sent by “Tree Hole Robot No. 006”. The whispers of the suicidal people scrolled on the screen: “I want to die.” “I’m not afraid of anything. I just have lost hope for and confidence in life. I just want to die.” “Does anyone want to commit suicide? I’m in Jinan.” “I hope to leave this hypocritical and cruel world in my dream.” Zhisheng remained silent for a good while, “We still have a fairly long way to go.”\nSource: Hope 24 Hotline, Tree Hole Action, provincial official websites of suicide prevention institutions, Suicide Prevention Resource Centre, 181498 comments from Zou Fan\u0026rsquo;s microblog from Oct. 2018 to Feb. 2019, Preventing suicide: A global imperative-WHO, and related news report.\n","date":"January 1, 2020","permalink":"/posts/data_journalism/","section":"Projects","summary":"This is a data journalism I did with Jin Wan, Siyu Zhou, and Mengying Li on Data Journalism at RUC Journalism.\nAt 1:41 in the afternoon the next day, the girl who sent the suicidal message was on the train from Lanzhou to Wuchang.","title":"Suicide Crisis Prevention in China"},{"content":"","date":"January 1, 1","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"January 1, 1","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"Thank you for your visit!
